# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Replace Tier 1's Go `tls-client` subprocess with pinned `node-wreq` 3.2.1 and its Firefox 148 TLS/HTTP2 profile. Reuse native connections while preserving encoded response bytes, scoped CA trust, proxy and certificate policy, redirect validation, and early challenge detection. Enforce caller deadlines and test timeout-bounded native cleanup under concurrent cancellation; remove the Go helper and toolchain requirements. Tier 0, browser tiers and residential proxies are unchanged.

- Add optional `BROWSER_HARDWARE_CONCURRENCY` to size native browser PoW workers on small deployments; skip Anubis crash retries after a confirmed container OOM kill.

- Keep Anubis PoW in the native browser with lightweight DOM polling, bounded waits, stale-session recovery and destination checks (#189).

### Added

- Detect Anubis (TecharoHQ) proof-of-work and metarefresh interstitials, which are served at HTTP 200 and were previously returned to callers as successful Tier 1 content. Escalate them to the browser tiers, whose JS resolves the challenge by itself; a wall that persists after waiting reports `anubis-persistent` (#189).
- Add opt-in `USER_PREFS` for Firefox launch preferences, including `network.dns.blockDotOnion` for existing Tor deployments. Validate preference values at startup, forward the setting through Docker Compose and retain proxy fail-closed and remote SOCKS DNS settings (#202).

- Add opt-in `MITM_ESCALATE_429` for proxy HTTP 429 responses. Keep the default pass-through behavior, avoid caching plain rate limits as host-wide challenges, and preserve the original response when scraping fails (#181).

- Add opt-in `followMetaRefresh` to the native scrape API: HTTP forwarders escalate to browser tiers, which follow bounded meta refresh redirects using the document base URL and existing proxy, cookies, outbound policy and TLS checks. Browser navigation interruptions are handled within the same deadline; network error documents, failed navigation, loops and spent refresh budgets fail the attempt instead of returning forwarding content. Addresses the request in #184 and the gaps identified in #185.

### Fixed

- Detect proxy redirects to Google Search's `/sorry/` challenge and enter the existing scraper ladder instead of forwarding the redirect to the client. Escalate final HTTP challenge pages and reject browser results that remain on the challenge URL (#180).

- Return the raw document for non-HTML text responses: browser tiers no longer expose Firefox's plain-text viewer shell as `html`, and the MCP `read` tool passes plain-text, JSON and XML documents through untouched instead of readability-parsing them. Preserve text whitespace and empty files across tiers, honor declared charsets with a UTF-8 fallback, and accept short non-HTML text documents in fresh browser tiers (#198).

- Avoid false Imperva challenge detection from documentation, cookie-name mentions, inactive markup, and ordinary CDN response headers; retain active resource frames, sensor bootstrap shells, and Imperva error response detection (#182).

- Serve browser-rendered HTML through the MITM proxy with a UTF-8 charset while preserving the original bytes and charset of Tier 1 HTML responses (#186).

- Send the Firefox navigation header set (`Accept`, zstd `Accept-Encoding`, `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`, `Sec-Fetch-Dest/Mode/Site/User`, `Priority`) from Tier 1, matching what the Camoufox browser tiers present, and drop the extra `Cache-Control`/`Pragma` so plain HTTP requests no longer diverge from browser requests on header fingerprints (#190).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Add persistent, bounded SQLite scrape metrics and a local dashboard with live activity, readable history charts and hover details, optional loopback tokenless access, early request failures, request and failure details, and local JSON export (#178).
- Capture a selected page element in MCP and native browser screenshots (#175).
- Allow MCP extraction to render JavaScript pages and wait for visible content before selecting fields (#173).
- Add bounded full-page screenshots and visible-selector waits to browser screenshot requests and the MCP `screenshot` tool.
- Add an MCP `extract` tool for bounded, CSS-selected JSON records from known public URLs.

### Changed

- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.7.0`, refresh compatible transitive dependencies, update the standard API runtime base to Debian 13, and update the web and docs images to nginx `1.31.6`. Retain Debian 12 for the baseline image's legacy kernel target.
- Align the local dashboard's typography, colors, and controls with the TRAWL landing page (#178).

### Fixed

- Reclaim a browser that disconnects during an active checkout at the next health check, and expose queue depth and checkout age in `/stats` for diagnosing pool contention.
- Keep tier attempt histories and MCP scrape metadata limited to status, duration and reason, excluding response bodies, headers and cookies.

## [1.6.5] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.6.5` and refresh all dependencies to their latest mutually compatible releases.
- Default the browser pool to one warm Camoufox instance for memory-efficient Prowlarr and ordinary scraper deployments; larger pools remain opt-in for concurrent browser solves (#164).
- Emit correlated request, tier, success, failure, and memory-pressure logs at the default `info` level. Add `LOG_LEVEL` controls, redact sensitive request metadata from correlated entries, and expose cgroup memory/OOM diagnostics on `/health` (#164).

## [1.6.4] - 2026-09-23

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.6.4`.

### Fixed
- Trust the active local TRAWL MITM proxy CA only for requests explicitly routed back through that listener, fixing `/v1` and `/scrape` self-proxy failures without changing system trust or weakening TLS for other proxies (#160).

## [1.6.3] - 2026-09-22

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.6.3`.
- Refresh compatible transitive dependencies and Redis to `8.10.2`; all direct package, browser, container, and CI dependencies are at their latest mutually compatible versions.

### Added
- Optional invalid-certificate loading: `ignoreCertificateErrors: true` on `POST /scrape` loads a page whose TLS certificate fails verification (expired, self-signed, issued for another host) instead of failing the fetch, and reports why verification failed in `ScrapeResult.certificateError`. Off by default and per request: Tier 1 retries only the failed TLS hop without replaying successful requests, Tiers 3 and 4 set it on the temporary context created for that one request, and the pooled contexts every other caller uses stay verified. Tier 2 is skipped for these requests — it replays its session inside the shared pool context, whose TLS policy cannot be changed per request — and is reported as `skipped` in `timings`. Because an unverified connection no longer proves whose page came back, an opted-in request also runs a crossed-landing guard: a scrape that ends on a host the requested URL is not part of is re-checked with a plain HTTP fetch over the same egress, and only when that probe stays on the requested host is the landing refused (`crossed-landing on <host>` in `timings`, the ladder moving to the next tier, and a terminal error naming the refused landing when no tier returns an uncrossed page). An inconclusive or equally off-host probe keeps the page, and the same off-host landing reached from two independent egresses is accepted as a browser-only redirect. The probe shares the request's remaining `maxTimeout` across every redirect and validates every hop against the configured outbound policy.
- Optional favicon collection: `favicons: true` on `POST /scrape` returns the page's icons in `ScrapeResult.favicons` (`url`, `contentType`, base64 `data`, or `error`). A page may declare several icons — size and device variants, `apple-touch-icon`, `mask-icon` — and the browser renders exactly one; this returns the whole declared set plus the apex `/favicon.ico`, resolved against `document.baseURI` and de-duplicated. Each is fetched with `fetch()` **in page context**, so the requests carry the origin's cookies and the session's challenge clearance rather than arriving as an unauthenticated stranger a bot wall answers 403. Off by default — without the flag nothing is resolved and no request is made. Icon count, streamed body bytes, metadata length, per-fetch time and total collection time are bounded and tunable via `FAVICON_*`, and the request's own remaining `maxTimeout` caps the last of them. An icon that could not be read comes back with its own `error` rather than vanishing, and collection runs after the response listeners are drained so these fetches never land in `networkLogs`, `capturedResponses`, `timings` or the MHTML archive.

### Fixed
- Preserve encoded Tier 1 response bodies so MITM clients do not attempt to decompress already-decoded content (#152).

## [1.6.2] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.6.2`.
- Refresh Biome, nginx, and uBlock Origin to their latest mutually compatible releases.

### Fixed
- Return terminal challenge HTML and its upstream status through the MITM proxy, allowing downstream clients to distinguish blocked targets from gateway failures while retaining `502 Bad Gateway` for infrastructure errors (#147).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.6.1`.
- Publish rolling nightly images from the latest verified `dev` revision every day at 02:00 UTC instead of on stable `main` pushes, allow manual nightly dispatch, and cancel superseded nightly runs (#137).
- Stop publishing the optional `-fonts` release flavor automatically. Published images remain compact and use Linux fingerprints; deployments needing the complete Windows/macOS/Linux font pool can build with `CAMOUFOX_KEEP_SPOOFED_OS_FONTS=1`.

### Fixed
- Detect dynamic ALTCHA challenge pages beyond the former 4 KiB inspection window, classify only strong interstitial markers as walls, and keep post-verification settling within the request deadline (#140).
- Resolve destination hostnames through configured SOCKS5 proxies instead of the container's local DNS, preventing DNS leaks and restoring access when the local resolver blocks or poisons the target domain (#136).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-15

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.6.0`.
- Refresh compatible runtime, browser, build, and container dependencies for the release.

### Added
- Add `SCRAPE_PROXY_SELECTION=failover|roundrobin|random` for Tier 3 and Tier 4 proxy pools. The default preserves sticky per-domain challenge sessions, while opt-in round-robin or random selection can spread proxy-backed scrape requests across healthy endpoints (#129).
- Add `SCRAPE_MIN_TIER=1|2|3|4` as a deployment-wide floor for `/scrape`, FlareSolverr `/v1`, MCP, and MITM scraper fallback requests. This lets operators bypass plain HTTP, cached sessions, or fresh direct browser solves when an earlier attempt would poison a target's fingerprint or bypass the intended proxy tier (#128).
- Optional MHTML archive: `mhtml: true` on `POST /scrape` returns a bounded `multipart/related` archive of successful HTML pages from browser tiers. The rendered document is followed by the safely readable stylesheets, scripts, images, and fonts observed during the normal page lifetime; omitted resources are reported inside the archive (#125).
- Optional `blockedEvidence` diagnostics for terminal `/scrape` failures, returning bounded challenge-wall HTML and an optional screenshot without changing the HTTP 500 failure semantics. Evidence covers all browser challenge detectors, stays within the request budget, and is omitted unless explicitly requested (#124).
- Publish a `-fonts` flavor of every release image (`:X.Y.Z-fonts`, `:latest-fonts`) with the complete spoofed Windows/macOS font bundles. Compact images now limit their runtime fingerprint pool to Linux when those bundles are absent, preventing rendered output and font probes from contradicting the advertised OS (#123).
- Pluggable session cache driver selectable via `SESSION_CACHE_DRIVER` (`redis` default, bounded `memory` for single-instance deployments). The minimal Compose variant uses memory by default; `MEMORY_SESSION_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` limits it with LRU eviction (#117).
- Local, provider-specific solving for embedded ALTCHA and Friendly Captcha v1/v2 proof-of-work widgets in browser tiers (#121).

### Fixed
- Remove stale content-encoding and representation metadata from browser-backed MITM proxy responses after Playwright has decoded their bodies, preventing clients such as .NET `HttpClient` from attempting a second decompression while preserving raw Tier 1 responses (#126).
- Detect DuckDuckGo anomaly challenge walls in Tier 1 and the MITM proxy, escalating them to browser tiers instead of returning challenge HTML as successful content (#119).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.5.0`.
- Updated all direct and compatible transitive dependencies to their latest available releases, including Bun 1.4.0, Camoufox 152.0.4-beta.29, uBlock Origin 1.74.0, Biome 2.5.12, Elysia 1.4.30, Zod 4.5.4, and Patchright 1.62.3. Playwright Core remains on 1.60.0 for Camoufox compatibility, and the Nuxt app remains on TypeScript 5.9.3 for vue-tsc compatibility.
- Reorganized runtime configuration into concise subsystem namespaces. Console/network limits now use `DIAGNOSTICS_*`, redirect-chain limits use `REDIRECT_*`, response-body limits remain under `CAPTURE_*`, forward-proxy settings use `MITM_*`, and Redis session expiry is `REDIS_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`. `BROWSER_MAX_CONTENT_PROCESSES` now makes the process cap explicit; the unused `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` entry was removed. These names replace the previous environment variables without compatibility aliases; the [configuration migration guide](apps/docs/deployment/configuration-migration.md) contains the complete mapping.
- An empty or unset `REDIS_URL` now disables the optional session cache without attempting a localhost connection or requiring a separate enable flag.
- Supplied Compose variants now explicitly pass every supported runtime tuning variable from `.env` into the container instead of silently ignoring screenshot, diagnostics, redirect, response-capture, and CAPTCHA settings.
- Renamed internal byte/character limits to `STREAM_THRESHOLD_BYTES` and `MCP_HTML_MAX_CHARS`, and namespaced the Camoufox font-retention build argument as `CAMOUFOX_KEEP_SPOOFED_OS_FONTS`.

### Added
- Expanded the optional MCP server with purpose-specific `read`, `scrape`, `screenshot`, and `inspect` tools. AI clients can now receive readability-extracted Markdown/text, native image content, richer scrape metadata, or bounded browser diagnostics without exposing cookies, sessions, request headers, proxy credentials, or captured API response bodies. The original `scrape_url` remains as a compatibility alias.
- Optional `MITM_ALWAYS_SCRAPE=true` mode skips the forward proxy's direct Tier 0 probe and routes ordinary HTTP requests immediately into the existing scraper ladder for sites where the probe itself triggers a temporary ban (#93). WebSocket relays remain direct; the mode is off by default and documented as unsuitable for general media/download traffic because it bypasses Tier 0 streaming.
- **DataDome support.** Detect Device Check, slider CAPTCHA and `t=bv` hard blocks from challenge markers and `x-dd-b`. Device Check uses a dedicated waiter and an optional headful Xvfb pool; the slider is reported as `datadome-captcha-required`. Enable startup-warmed capacity with `BROWSER_HEADFUL_POOL_SIZE=1` (off by default).
- **AWS WAF Challenge support.** Detect the documented `202` Challenge and `405` CAPTCHA responses from their `x-amzn-waf-action` header, with a conservative two-marker HTML fallback. Silent challenges use a dedicated browser waiter for the domain-matching `aws-waf-token`; interactive CAPTCHA is surfaced as `aws-waf-captcha-required` for a future solver.
- Optional response-body capture: `captureResponses` on `POST /scrape` takes URL patterns (a substring, or a glob when the pattern contains `*` or `?`) and returns the matching responses' bodies in `ScrapeResult.capturedResponses`, so a page that ships an empty shell and loads its content over a background request is still readable. `settleTimeout` holds the page open after load waiting for a match and `waitForSelector` ends that window early. Off by default — without patterns no listener is attached. Pattern count, body count, per-body bytes and total bytes are bounded and tunable via `CAPTURE_*`; a body over its budget comes back trimmed and flagged `truncated`, a binary or unknown content type comes back base64, and a body that cannot be read carries its own `error` rather than failing the scrape.
- Optional console, network and redirect-chain capture: `consoleLogs`, `networkLogs` and `redirectChain` on `POST /scrape` return the page's console messages, per-request resource timings, and the URLs the main document walked (`ScrapeResult.consoleLogs` / `networkLogs` / `redirectChain`), captured by the browser tiers (2-4). Each flag is independent and off by default — without it no listener is attached and nothing is buffered. Diagnostics use `DIAGNOSTICS_*` limits and redirect chains use independent `REDIRECT_*` limits; anything past a cap is dropped whole rather than truncated, and a capture failure leaves the field unset rather than failing the scrape.
- Optional viewport screenshot: `screenshot: true` on `POST /scrape` returns a base64 JPEG of the viewport in `ScrapeResult.screenshot`, captured by the browser tiers (2-4) immediately before the HTML read so image and markup describe the same moment. Off by default; a stock request attaches nothing and does no extra work. Settle wait, capture timeout, JPEG quality, and maximum image size are bounded and tunable via `SCREENSHOT_*`, and a capture failure leaves the field unset rather than failing the scrape.

### Fixed
- Gate every nightly, release, and baseline container publish on a successful clean `bun run verify`, preventing images from being pushed when CI fails. Update the Biome schema and web formatting for Biome 2.5.12.
- Add RFC 5280 Subject Key Identifiers to generated MITM roots and leaf certificates and a matching Authority Key Identifier to leaves, restoring compatibility with strict TLS clients such as Python 3.13 (#113). Existing roots missing SKI are re-signed once with the same CA key and identity fields; initialization is serialized across processes and invalid existing identifiers fail safely. Because migration changes the certificate fingerprint, existing MITM deployments should download and re-import the updated `ca.crt` into client trust stores.
- Recover the Redis-backed Tier 2 cache after a transient startup timeout without restarting TRAWL. Connection attempts are bounded by `REDIS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`, retry in the background after `REDIS_RETRY_DELAY_MS`, and stop cleanly during shutdown; setting the retry delay to `0` disables reconnects for intentionally cacheless deployments (#92).
- Correct Docker troubleshooting commands to use the actual `trawl` Compose service name, and distinguish Prowlarr's always-available FlareSolverr API on port 8191 from the opt-in forward proxy on port 8192 (#96).
- Wait for the bundled Redis service to pass a `PING` healthcheck before starting TRAWL, preventing a transient Compose startup race from disabling the Tier 2 session cache for the process lifetime (#90).
- Reap orphaned Camoufox processes in both API container variants by running Bun under Tini (#79).
- Preserve every upstream `Set-Cookie` field across direct, Tier 1, and browser-backed proxy responses, serializing each cookie as its own HTTP header instead of dropping or malformedly folding repeated values (#64).
- Treat an explicit request-level `proxy` as a strict routing guarantee: route HTTP(S) Tier 1 requests through it, skip direct Tier 1 for SOCKS, bypass the unproxied Tier 2 cache, prevent proxy-derived sessions from entering the shared domain cache, disable Firefox direct failover, and surface authentication, transport, protocol, and `Proxy-Status` failures as errors instead of successful content (#73).

## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.4.2`.

### Fixed
- Detect and resolve DDoS-Guard JS interstitials without misclassifying them as Cloudflare challenges (#66).

## [1.4.1] - 2026-08-21

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.4.1`.
- Update the container and development runtime to Bun 1.4.0, Biome to 2.5.10, Bun types to 1.4.0, Patchright to 1.62.1, Nuxt SEO to 5.3.14, and vue-tsc to 3.3.11.
- Update GeoLite2 City to 2026.08.19 after the previously pinned upstream release became unavailable.
- Keep Playwright Core on 1.60.0 for Camoufox compatibility and the Nuxt app on TypeScript 5.9.3 for vue-tsc compatibility; other workspaces use TypeScript 7.0.2.

### Fixed
- Remove the unused native TypeScript compiler from both production API images and fail image builds if a native `@typescript/typescript-*` artifact is present, eliminating its fixable HIGH runtime CVEs (#68).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-10

### Changed
- **Cold-start performance milestone:** TRAWL's complete first request, including browser launch, is now nearly **4x faster** in like-for-like Docker benchmarks. Redis validation and browser warmup now run concurrently, Tier 0 becomes available immediately, and browser capacity is published progressively. Warm-request timings vary with browser state, session caching, and challenge behavior and are not included in this cold-start comparison.
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.4.0`.
- Update Biome to 2.5.7, Memoirist to 1.2.2, Nuxt to 4.5.2, and Nuxt SEO to 5.3.11. TypeScript remains on 5.9.3 for the Nuxt app and Playwright remains on 1.60.0 for Camoufox compatibility.
- Update GitHub Actions to their current stable major releases and make the CI release gate read-only and reproducible.
- Pin the runtime to Bun 1.3.14, Camoufox v152.0.4-beta.28, GeoLite2 City 2026.08.07, and Redis 8.8.1, with SHA-256 verification for downloaded browser/runtime data assets.
- The remaining audit findings are confined to Nuxt/VitePress development and build-time dependency trees; no compatible upstream update is currently available for those transitive packages.

### Fixed
- Support explicit non-root Docker users by baking the pinned uBlock Origin addon into both API image variants and using a writable temporary home directory. Document CA volume ownership and read-only container requirements (#60).
- Reduce cold-start latency by warming Redis alongside the browser pool, publishing the first browser immediately, warming the remaining browsers concurrently, and accepting Tier 0 proxy traffic during warmup. Unavailable Redis now disables Tier 2 promptly instead of delaying the first request. Tier 0 also handles informational HTTP responses correctly and escalates authoritative `cf-mitigated: challenge` headers immediately.
- Keep browser-tier status, headers, content type, and raw body aligned with the latest main-frame navigation response across redirects, and prevent persistent Cloudflare challenges from being returned as successful rendered pages (#53).
- Translate Prowlarr's serialized `headers.contentType` metadata at the FlareSolverr `/v1` compatibility boundary and discard `contentLength`, allowing form POST requests to enter the scraper pipeline (#50).
- Bound Camoufox memory growth by counting every Tier 3/4 temporary context and rolling-replacing browsers at `BROWSER_RECYCLE_AFTER_CONTEXTS`, while keeping existing capacity available during warm-up. Replacement launches are serialized, cleanup is timeout-bounded, and failed launches retain the usable browser (#52).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- Keep pooled browser contexts under `BrowserPool` ownership so repeat Tier 2 requests cannot reuse a context closed by a separate cache (#45).

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.3.1`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- Detect and resolve Akamai Bot Manager behavioral interstitials across scraper tiers and the HTTP/HTTPS proxy (#33).
- Document supported upstream proxy formats, local Compose configuration, and residential proxy pools (#26).

### Fixed
- Reject non-object request bodies and missing, non-string, or blank `url` values with HTTP 400 before scraper-tier execution (#34).
- Recover stalled browser checkouts and bound browser close/launch operations so wedged Firefox processes cannot silently exhaust the pool (#36, #37, #48).
- Report HTTP 503 from `/health` whenever the browser pool has no live capacity.
- Pass authenticated proxy credentials to Firefox separately from the proxy server URL in Tier 3 and Tier 4 (#40).
- Return complete Tier 1 text responses instead of the 4 KiB challenge-detection preview (#46, #47).
- Record the correct architecture-specific Camoufox release metadata in API images.

### Changed
- Bump all application and internal package versions to `1.3.0`.
- Update workspace dependencies to their latest compatible releases. TypeScript remains on 5.9 for the Nuxt app until `vue-tsc` supports TypeScript 7.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Tier 0 direct forward in the MITM proxy** (`apps/api/src/proxy/directForward.ts`): the proxy at `:8192` now forwards requests directly to upstream via raw TCP/TLS instead of spinning up a browser for every request. Pool is reserved for the requests that actually need CF bypass; Netflix/YouTube/banks/etc. flow at near-direct speed.
- **Smart adaptive streaming** (`apps/api/src/proxy/streaming.ts`): small JSON/HTML/text responses are buffered so the challenge detector can inspect them; video/audio/binary files (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.m3u8`, `.zip`, `.exe`, `.dmg`, etc.) are streamed straight through to the client. Default threshold: 8 MiB.
- **Per-hostname challenge cache** (`apps/api/src/proxy/challengeCache.ts`): the proxy remembers which hostnames recently returned Cloudflare challenges and sends repeat visits directly to the tiered solver for 5 minutes.
- **Persistent browser context cache**: solved sessions retain their browser fingerprint, cookies, cache, and storage across proxy requests, with bounded per-proxy reuse and cleanup.
- **General HTTP/HTTPS proxy support**: CONNECT tunneling, plain HTTP absolute-form requests, WebSocket upgrades, request bodies, redirects, authentication headers, cookies, and HTTP Range/206 responses are forwarded with their required semantics.
- **`proxySanitizeHeaders()`** (`packages/tiers/src/utils/sanitize.ts`): permissive header sanitizer for the transparent MITM proxy — passes `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Range`, `User-Agent`, `Referer`, and custom API tokens through, strips only RFC 7230 hop-by-hop headers.
- **Raw bytes in `@trawl/tiers`**: `ScrapeResult` and tier results now expose `body?: Uint8Array`, `responseHeaders?: Record<string,string>`, and `contentType?: string` alongside the existing `html` field. The proxy uses these fields to preserve binary content without HTML normalization.
- **Tier 1 method handling fix**: `runTier1()` now forwards the request body for `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `QUERY` (was only `POST`).
- **Graceful proxy shutdown** (`shutdownMitmProxy()`): the API captures the proxy handle on startup and `lifecycle.ts` calls `shutdownMitmProxy()` on `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` before the browser pool shutdown, so in-flight connections drain.
- **MITM proxy port + CA volume in docker-compose**: `8192:8192` port mapping, `MITM_PROXY_*` env vars, and a persistent `trawl_proxy_ca` volume so the CA survives container restarts.
- **Proxy tests**: header sanitization, response policy, adaptive streaming, challenge caching, direct HTTP forwarding, Range/206 handling, chunked responses, compressed challenge detection, and explicit media streaming.
- **Proxy documentation**: architecture, configuration, client setup, and CA installation guides for operating systems, browsers, Java/JDownloader, containers, and application-specific trust stores.

### Changed
- `packages/types/src/index.ts` — `ScrapeResult` extended additively with optional `body`, `responseHeaders`, and `contentType`; native `/scrape` consumers should tolerate these additional fields.
- `apps/api/src/proxy/server.ts` — `fetchRaw`/`reissue` replaced by `proxyRequest()` (Tier 0 with `scrape()` fallback) for both CONNECT-based HTTPS and plain HTTP traffic.
- `lifecycle.ts` — `registerLifecycleHandlers()` accepts an optional `{ onShutdown }` callback.
- `apps/api/src/index.ts` — captures the proxy handle on startup and wires it into `registerLifecycleHandlers`.
- All application and internal package versions bumped to `1.2.0`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Browser-backed MITM forward-proxy mode** (`MITM_PROXY_ENABLED`, off by default): HTTP(S) forward proxy that re-issues requests through the browser pool so clients like Prowlarr, Jackett, JDownloader, and changedetection.io can hit fingerprint-bound Cloudflare sites that the `/v1` cookie handoff cannot. The generated root CA is persisted, per-host certificates are minted in memory, and the root is downloadable at `GET /proxy-ca.crt`. New env: `MITM_PROXY_{ENABLED,PORT,HOST,CA_DIR,MAX_TIER,DEBUG}`.

### Changed
- `fetchRaw` rotates `proxyPool` on Cloudflare challenge (same `markBad → next()` pattern as Tier 3) instead of retrying on the same IP.
- Main MITM proxy listener supports a configurable bind address through `MITM_PROXY_HOST`.
- `ci.yml` runs on PRs targeting `dev` in addition to `main`.
- `publish.yml` inspects the actually-pushed tag from `docker/metadata-action` instead of re-deriving from `github.sha` (which previously mismatched the 7-char short SHA).
- `node-forge ^1.3.1` runtime dep for CA + per-host leaf cert generation.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-18

### Changed
- `packages/browser/src/pool.ts` — renamed Firefox prefs key from `prefs` (silently ignored by camoufox-js@0.11.1) to `firefox_user_prefs` (which camoufox-js maps to Playwright's `firefoxUserPrefs`). The prefs are now actually applied.
- `packages/browser/src/pool.ts` — added the safe-only subset of Firefox prefs: telemetry off (`datareporting.*`, `toolkit.telemetry.*`, `app.crashreporter`, `breakpad.*`), dead UI features off (`extensions.screenshots.*`, `browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo`), dead network services off (`browser.safebrowsing.*`, `extensions.update.*`, `browser.fixup.alternate.*`, `app.normandy.*`, `app.shield.*`, `network.connectivity-service.*`, `network.captive-portal-service.*`, `network.prefetch-next`, `beacon.enabled`), `security.OCSP.enabled: 0`, and tightened network timeouts (`tls-handshake-timeout: 30`, `connection-timeout: 60`, `response.timeout: 120`). None of these touch the JS/CSS fingerprint surface.
- `apps/api/Dockerfile` — stage-3 prune of apt cache + `/usr/share/{locale,doc,man}` (image-size win, runtime-neutral).
- `apps/api/Dockerfile` — added 9 Bun runtime ENV flags (`BUN_DISABLE_CJS=1`, `BUN_DEBUG=0`, `BUN_DISABLE_SOURCEMAPS=1`, `BUN_HTTP_KEEPALIVE=0`, `BUN_AGENT_DISABLE=1`, `BUN_INSPECT=0`, `BUN_LOCKFILE_MIGRATION=false`, `MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY=0`, `NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1`). All verified runtime-neutral in smoke tests.
- `packages/browser/package.json` — moved `patchright` + `playwright-core` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` (build hygiene; camoufox-js bundles both transitively at runtime).
- All packages bumped to `1.0.1`.

### Added
- `scripts/bench-targets.sh`, `scripts/bench-success-rate.sh`, `scripts/bench-compare.sh` — observability harnesses for measuring CF challenge latency + bypass success rate.
## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Shared types (`BrowserHandle`, `BrowserFingerprint`, `SupportedMethod`) centralized instead of
  being duplicated per-package
- `packages/tiers` split into `tiers/` and `utils/`, deduplicating cookie and network-failure
  helpers; `apps/api`'s entrypoint split into `config`, `deps`, and `routes`, adding a proper
  root status route
- Evaluated switching the cache backend to [Dragonfly](https://www.dragonflydb.io/) and reverted:
  benchmarking showed Dragonfly only wins throughput when load is spread across multiple
  connections, but `packages/browser`'s `SessionCache` holds a single shared `RedisClient`
  connection for the process lifetime — so at TRAWL's actual access pattern, plain Redis is
  faster at every scale tested, regardless of `BROWSER_POOL_SIZE`. Docker Compose configs
  (`docker-compose.yml`, `.full.yml`, `.prod.yml`) now pin `redis:8.8-alpine`; the `redis`
  service name and `REDIS_URL` env var are unchanged from before the Dragonfly experiment.

### Added
- Landing page shows a live GitHub star count

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Audio STT fallback for the hCaptcha solver

### Fixed
- JS-only challenge pages that only look like plain HTML now correctly escalate from Tier 1 to
  the browser tiers (#22, #23)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- `BROWSER_RECYCLE_AFTER_CONTEXTS` env var (default `8`, set `0` to disable) bounds long-running
  browser process growth by recycling the pooled Camoufox/Firefox instance after a configurable
  number of Tier 3/Tier 4 temporary context creations
- `BROWSER_CONTENT_PROCESSES` env var (default `2`) caps Firefox content processes per pooled
  browser via the `dom.ipc.processCount` Firefox pref. Firefox's default of 8 lets thread count
  climb when Tier 3/Tier 4 churn disposable contexts (see #13). The cap bounds the leak at the
  source without needing to restart the browser.
- Browser fingerprints now randomize OS/screen/window per instance and match the HTTP
  `User-Agent` to the emulated platform

### Changed
- `BROWSER_RECYCLE_AFTER_CONTEXTS` no longer recycles preemptively after every N temporary
  contexts. The pool now recycles only when Tier 3 or Tier 4 returns a `blocked` / `needs-js`
  outcome, preserving cookies, `cf_clearance`, and warm fingerprint state across successful
  solves. This eliminates the HTTP-429 storm observed in single-browser setups where the
  previous "recycle every N uses" logic left the only browser `restarting=true` for ~13s during
  every recycle window (#17, thanks @CoolDotty)
- Tier detection now recognizes more block/error page variants; Tier 4 gains full captcha
  parity, with proxy/timing info surfaced in responses (#19, thanks @edasque)

### Fixed
- Missing `curl` in the API runtime image broke healthchecks (#20, #21)
- Missing GeoLite2 mmdb caused a GeoIP startup crash on boot; now baked into the image (#20, #21)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Native `method` + `body` support across all four scraper tiers — the
  `FlareSolverrRequest.cmd=request.post` body is now actually delivered upstream instead of
  being silently dropped (thanks @whoshoe for the original POST support)
- `ScrapeRequest.method` accepts the full standard verb set: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`,
  `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `QUERY` (RFC 9341). `CONNECT` is intentionally excluded
  (tunneling verb, inappropriate for a proxy)
- POST / `*` request bodies are forwarded **uncapped** — operators who want a byte ceiling
  should impose it at their ingress / fronting proxy
- Body-bearing requests require a `Content-Type` header; the tier functions no longer
  auto-inject `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which previously mislabelled JSON / XML
  bodies
- `ScrapeRequest` field renamed from `postData` → `body` for REST-idiomatic naming.
  (`FlareSolverrRequest.postData` is unchanged because it's the upstream wire contract.)
- Native Imperva/Incapsula WAF challenge detection and solving in Tier 3 and Tier 4
- Proxy rotator reworked into a sticky, failure-aware pool with per-request override support
- `PORT_API` env var renamed to `PORT` and made properly configurable (#9, #10)

### Security
- Reserved-name header denylist prevents callers from spoofing `cf_clearance` cookies,
  overriding the per-tier `User-Agent`, or rewriting routing signals (`X-Forwarded-For`, `Host`)
  during a POST bypass flow

### Fixed
- `/v1` now accepts Prowlarr's Cardigann `FlareSolverrProxy` object shape
  (`{url, username, password}`) for the per-request `proxy` field, instead of crashing with
  `proxy.server: expected string, got object` when Prowlarr sends it through (#12, #15). The
  boundary normalises both the object form and a plain URL string into a single URL string
  before the orchestrator forwards it to Playwright/Camoufox. Credentials are URL-encoded so
  embedded `@`/`:` characters survive the round-trip.

### Limitations
- The Playwright `page.route(url, …)` interceptor only handles the first top-frame GET to that
  exact URL. Server redirects to a different URL, XHR sub-resources, and chained `POST→POST`
  form flows do not have the `postData` override applied
- No idempotency-key support; transient network failures and pool churn can re-fire a POST
  (separate ticket)

### Tests
- `packages/tiers/tests/sanitize.test.ts` — header sanitiser, method allowlist, postData size
  cap, Content-Type enforcement
- `packages/tiers/tests/runTier1Post.test.ts` — tier1 GET/POST round-trip and User-Agent
  non-override
- Run via `bun --cwd packages/tiers test`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- `:baseline` Docker image variant for pre-AVX2 CPUs and older kernels, published to its own
  GHCR tag — confirmed working on a Synology DS920+ (DSM 7.3.2, kernel 4.4.302), see #1

### Fixed
- Docker healthchecks failing, root-caused to `wget` vs. the runtime image; switched to a
  `curl`-based healthcheck with a proper timeout and start period (#3, #4)
- Startup crash loop (`EISDIR`, missing `memoirist`/`camoufox-js`) fixed by switching
  `bun install` to `--linker=hoisted` (#1, #6)
- `/health` now correctly returns 503 while the browser pool is still initializing

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Configurable browser pool concurrency limiter to guard against OOM under burst load
- `BROWSER_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_MS` env var, default 15s

### Changed
- A saturated browser pool now returns HTTP 429 instead of a raw 500
- Default `BROWSER_POOL_SIZE` raised to 3

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Custom `headers` field on `ScrapeRequest`, forwarded through Tier 1-4 via URL-scoped route
  interception and exposed on `/v1` and `/scrape` with CORS support
- `cmd` is now optional on `/v1`, defaulting to `request.get`

### Changed
- Multi-arch Docker publish now runs on native arm64 runners with a two-phase per-digest build
  and manifest merge

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Initial release with 4-tier execution engine
- Native captcha solving for Cloudflare Turnstile, reCAPTCHA v2 (audio STT), hCaptcha (audio
  bypass), and GeeTest v3 slider
- Persistent browser pool with real Camoufox Firefox
- Session caching via Redis
