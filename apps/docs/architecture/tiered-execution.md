# Tiered Execution

Every scrape request runs through a four-tier waterfall. Each tier is only tried if the previous one fails or is skipped. This means you pay the cheapest cost that works for each request — most requests never need a browser.

```
Request
  │
  ▼
Tier 1: Plain HTTP Fetch ─── success ──→ return (< 100ms)
  │ blocked / needs-js
  ▼
Tier 2: Cached Session ────── success ──→ return (~500ms)
  │ blocked / cache miss
  ▼
Tier 3: Fresh Challenge ───── success ──→ cache cookies, return
  │ IP flagged
  ▼
Tier 4: Residential Proxy ─── success ──→ cache cookies, return (15–45s)
  │ failed
  ▼
  error
```

## Tier 1 — Plain HTTP Fetch

The cheapest tier. Uses a Go subprocess built with vendored `tls-client` v1.16.0
and its `Firefox_148` TLS/HTTP2 profile. Navigation headers use the corresponding
Firefox user-agent; this is not an exact match to the separately pinned Camoufox
browser. This product includes tls-client software developed by Bogdan Finn.

```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:148.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/148.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: none
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Priority: u=0, i
```

**Succeeds for:** sites that serve the requested content without a browser challenge.

**Escalates for:** recognized Cloudflare, Akamai, or Imperva challenge responses and blocked status codes such as 403 or 429. Detection uses provider-specific headers and HTML markers.

**Skip with:** `skipHttp: true` in the request body, or deployment-wide `SCRAPE_MIN_TIER=2`.
Use `maxTier: 1` to cap execution at Tier 1 instead.

The helper returns headers before streaming the encoded response bytes. Tier 1
retains redirect validation, certificate policy and challenge detection. Each hop
uses an isolated process with no shared cookie jar; browser sessions are not
injected into static requests. MITM direct forwarding preserves caller cookies,
but escalation into the scraper applies its stricter header sanitizer.

There is no build-time fingerprint API or generated Camoufox profile. Docker
images include the helper; local development requires `bun run build:tls`.
The MITM listener's separate Tier 0 forwarder is unchanged. Use the existing
`MITM_ALWAYS_SCRAPE=true` setting to bypass that forwarder when using the proxy;
native `/scrape` already starts at Tier 1.

## Tier 2 — Cached Browser Session

Reads `session:{hostname}` from Redis. If found, injects the saved cookies into a pooled Firefox context and navigates. When the target accepts the cached protection cookies and browser identity, the site loads without a fresh challenge solve.

**Succeeds for:** previously solved domains whose cached session is still accepted.

**Fails for:** expired or rejected sessions. On failure, TRAWL invalidates the cached session and escalates to Tier 3.

## Tier 3 — Fresh Challenge Solve

Acquires a browser from the pool (or waits up to `BROWSER_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_MS` — default 15s — for one to become available), creates a fresh Camoufox context, and navigates without preloaded cookies. TRAWL identifies the wall and runs the matching Cloudflare, Akamai, or Imperva wait flow until the protected page replaces the interstitial or `maxTimeout` elapses.

On success:
- Extracts all cookies from the page context
- Writes `session:{hostname} → { cookies, userAgent, savedAt }` to Redis (TTL = `REDIS_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`)
- Returns the HTML and cookies to the caller

Uses [Camoufox](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox) — Firefox with fingerprint patching at the C++/Juggler level to reduce common automation signals. Success still depends on the target's challenge variant, IP reputation, and upstream network conditions.

### Akamai Bot Manager challenges

Tier 3 and Tier 4 detect Akamai's `sec-cpt` / SBSD behavioral interstitials. The Akamai flow generates human-like pointer movement, handles supported press-and-hold widgets, waits for a valid `_abck` sensor cookie, and revisits the original URL when the interstitial does not reload automatically.

Akamai configurations vary between properties and change over time. TRAWL treats a persistent interstitial as blocked and can escalate to Tier 4 when a residential proxy is configured.

### Imperva/Incapsula challenges

Tier 3 and Tier 4 also detect and resolve supported Imperva/Incapsula WAF challenges. Imperva's `reese84` (current) / `___utmvc` (legacy) sensor cookies are produced by an obfuscated in-page JS challenge. TRAWL detects the response with `packages/tiers/src/utils/detect.ts` and waits for the sensor cookie through `packages/tiers/src/utils/impervaWait.ts`.

Detection checks active challenge frames and sensor bootstrap shells. Cookie names in article text, inactive HTML examples, and ordinary Imperva CDN headers alone do not trigger browser escalation.

**Caveat:** unlike Turnstile, Imperva's script sometimes layers in TLS/JA3 and behavioral checks beyond plain cookie generation, and its obfuscation changes periodically — success isn't guaranteed at the same rate as Cloudflare. Some Imperva deployments also show a visible interactive CAPTCHA widget (distinct from hCaptcha/reCAPTCHA) instead of the passive sensor-only path; that variant isn't solved yet.

### DataDome challenges

Tier 3 and Tier 4 detect the three DataDome responses. All of them arrive through
`captcha-delivery.com`:

| Response | Marker | TRAWL action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device Check | `i.js` script, `dd.rt = 'i'` | Runs `packages/tiers/src/utils/datadomeWait.ts` and waits for a new `datadome` cookie |
| Slider CAPTCHA | `c.js` script, `dd.rt = 'c'` | Reports `datadome-captcha-required`. No solver yet |
| Hard block | `t=bv` on the challenge URL | Reports the IP as blocked and escalates to Tier 4 |

The block-only `x-dd-b` response header lets the MITM proxy escalate before the body arrives.

Some DataDome Device Check deployments require a browser running behind a display. TRAWL
sends detected DataDome work to an opt-in headful pool running behind Xvfb.

Tier 1 can select the pool before browser acquisition. If a later tier detects DataDome,
the orchestrator replaces the headless lease and retries that tier once. The optional pool
is warmed during startup.

The sub-pool is off by default: set `BROWSER_HEADFUL_POOL_SIZE=1` to scrape DataDome
targets. See [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration).

## Tier 4 — Residential Proxy Escalation

Same as Tier 3 but launches the browser with `RESIDENTIAL_PROXY_URL` set as the proxy. Only triggered when:

1. `RESIDENTIAL_PROXY_URL` is configured
2. Tier 3 failed (usually because the datacenter IP is flagged)

If `RESIDENTIAL_PROXY_URL` is not set, Tier 4 is skipped entirely and the request returns an error after Tier 3 fails.

## Tier selection

The orchestrator (`packages/tiers/src/orchestrator.ts`) controls escalation. You can limit it via `ScrapeRequest.maxTier`:

```json
{ "url": "...", "maxTier": 2 }
```

This runs Tier 1, then Tier 2, then returns an error if both fail — never launching a fresh browser solve.

## Timing reference

| Tier | Typical time | Browser used              |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1    | 50–150ms     | No                        |
| 2    | 400–700ms    | Yes (warm)                |
| 3    | Challenge-dependent | Yes (fresh solve)    |
| 4    | 15–45s       | Yes (fresh solve + proxy) |

Anubis uses the site's own JavaScript for proof of work. TRAWL polls a small browser DOM summary every 300 ms, respects the remaining request budget, and rejects denial pages or unresolved verification endpoints. Expired cached sessions escalate to a fresh browser context. PoW CPU and memory usage depend on the target policy and browser worker count; a 1 GiB limit is not sufficient for every public deployment.

A closed Anubis browser page may be retried once for GET or HEAD within the original timeout. If the container cgroup reports a new OOM kill, TRAWL stops instead of repeating the expensive solve. On systems without cgroup counters, recovery remains limited to one retry. POST requests are never replayed.
