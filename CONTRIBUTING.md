# Contributing to TRAWL

Thanks for your interest in contributing! TRAWL is a self-hosted web scraping engine released under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). By submitting a contribution, you agree to license your work under the same terms.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful, assume good faith, and focus on the technical merits.

## Reporting bugs & requesting features

Please use the GitHub issue templates — they ensure we have the context we need:

- **Bug reports:** [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- **Feature requests:** [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)

For security issues, **do not open a public issue** — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development setup

Requirements: **Bun 1.4.2** and **Docker** (for the Redis service used in tests).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/germondai/trawl.git
cd trawl
bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

### Running the apps

```bash
bun run dev:api     # Elysia API on :8191
bun run dev:web     # Nuxt 4 landing page
bun run dev:docs    # VitePress docs site
```

The API requires Redis. The fastest way is `docker compose up -d redis`.

### Linting & formatting

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for both:

```bash
bun run check       # read-only format, lint, and import-order check
bun run fix         # apply safe Biome fixes and formatting
bun run typecheck   # typecheck all five TypeScript workspaces
bun run build       # production-build the web and docs apps
bun run verify      # full release gate: check, types, tests, and builds
```

CI runs `bun run verify` on every PR.

Tier 1 uses the pinned `node-wreq` native addon with the explicit `firefox_148`
profile. `bun install` installs the platform-specific binary; optional native
dependencies must not be omitted. No Go toolchain or helper build is needed.
API startup loads the native binding and checks the profile when Tier 1 is enabled.
Update the package and browser profile together, retaining matching navigation
headers and running the transport, proxy, certificate and encoded-body tests.

The published images target Linux AMD64 and ARM64 (glibc). Both include
`/app/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` for the pinned native transport. Its inventory
covers the union of the two Linux dependency graphs, including build dependencies;
it does not inventory unrelated Windows, macOS, or musl targets.
When upgrading `node-wreq`, update the source revision in `tools/native-notices.ts`
and run `bun tools/native-notices.ts` with Docker, `gh`, and `tar` available.
The script uses upstream's pinned Rust version only to resolve dependencies,
without compiling or emulating ARM. Normal builds copy the static notices and
need no Rust toolchain. The inventory is not an attestation that the upstream
npm binaries were reproducibly built from that source.

### Browser integration tests

Meta refresh integration tests use a real Camoufox browser with local HTTP fixtures,
including a simulated cross-host challenge. They are skipped in the default test suite.
Install the compatible browser version pinned in `apps/api/Dockerfile` (currently
152.0.4-beta.30), then run:

```bash
TRAWL_BROWSER_TESTS=1 CAMOUFOX_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/camoufox bun test packages/browser/tests/metaRefresh.integration.test.ts
```

`CAMOUFOX_INSTALL_DIR` must contain the extracted browser bundle and its `version.json`.

Raw text browser integration tests use owned HTTP fixtures and a local forward proxy:

```bash
TRAWL_RAW_TEXT_TESTS=1 CAMOUFOX_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/camoufox bun test packages/browser/tests/rawText.integration.test.ts
```

They check TXT, JSON, XML, whitespace, empty files and declared charsets in browser
tiers, plus rejection of empty HTML and HTTP blocks.

Firefox preference integration tests cover both headless and virtual-display pools:

```bash
TRAWL_USER_PREFS_TESTS=1 CAMOUFOX_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/camoufox bun test packages/browser/tests/userPrefs.integration.test.ts
```

They use owned HTTP fixtures and local DNS mapping to check JavaScript preferences
and `.onion` blocking without requiring access to Tor.

## Project layout

This is a Bun monorepo with workspaces:

```
apps/
  api/      Elysia API (the scraper service)
  web/      Nuxt 4 landing page
  docs/     VitePress documentation
packages/
  browser/  Camoufox Firefox pool
  tiers/    Tier 1–4 execution engine
  types/    Shared TypeScript types
```

Apps are independently deployable; `packages/*` are imported via the workspace protocol (e.g. `workspace:*`).

## Commit conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Recent examples:

```
ci(publish): build images for linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7
chore: add .gitignore files for api, docs, web, and browser packages
fix(browser): restore pool after worker crash
```

The `type` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `ci`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`. Keep the subject under 72 chars and in the imperative mood.

## Pull request process

1. **Open an issue first** for non-trivial changes. A two-paragraph problem statement is enough.
2. **Branch from `main`.** Use a descriptive name (`feat/captcha-hcaptcha`, `fix/redis-reconnect`).
3. **Run `bun run verify` before pushing.** Lint, types, tests, and production builds must be clean.
4. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** under `## [Unreleased]` for any user-visible change.
5. **Fill out the PR template** — the checklist catches the easy-to-miss items.
6. **Keep PRs focused.** One feature or fix per PR; large refactors should be split.

## Adding a new tier or solver

TRAWL's design centers on a 4-tier escalation ladder (HTTP → cached session → fresh CF solve → residential proxy). If your contribution introduces a new tier or a new solver:

- Put tier logic in `packages/tiers/`.
- Put browser/solver adapters in `packages/browser/`.
- Update the tier diagram in `README.md`.
- Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
